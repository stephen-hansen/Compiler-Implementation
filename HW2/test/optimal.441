# This code basically plays to the best-case scenario for global value numbering
# Because GVN will run on SSA form, the initial 4+5 computation should be reused for the later cases, even though it's overwritten at the source level.

main with x, y, z:
    x = (4 + 5)
    x = 73
    y = (4 + 5)
    print(y)
    z = (4 + 5)
    print(z)
